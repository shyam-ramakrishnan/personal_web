# About Me

Hi! I am pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at North Carolina State University, Raleigh. My interests include cloud computing, machine learning, front end development and software practices in continuous deployment and configuration management.  

Besides academics, I love progressive rock music. Playing guitar and exploring different guitar gears is one of my passions. I also love soccer and have played competitive soccer in local leagues.

# About Me

I am a Master's student at North Carolina State University, Raleigh, majoring in Computer Science. My interests include java programming, cloud computing, machine learning, microservices, software configuration management and continuous integration.  

Besides academics, I am a big fan of progressive rock music. Playing guitar and exploring different guitar gears is one of my passions. I also love soccer and have played competitive soccer in local leagues.

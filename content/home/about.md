# About Me

I am a Master's student at North Carolina State University, Raleigh, majoring in Computer Science. My interests include java programming, cloud computing, machine learning, micro services and software practices in continuous deployment and configuration management.  

Besides academics, I am a big fan of progressive rock music. Playing guitar and exploring different guitar gears is one of my passions. I also love soccer and have played competitive soccer in local leagues.
